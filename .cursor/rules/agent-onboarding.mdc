# CRITICAL: Read Before Any Work

Before making ANY code changes on this project, you MUST first read these files in order:

1. `.agent/workflows/onboarding.md` - Project rules, design decisions, and guidelines
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Current project state, architecture, and what's done vs pending

Do NOT proceed with implementation until you have read both files and understand:
- The current project architecture
- Design decisions that must not be overridden
- Code style requirements (rich-click, #45c1ff theme, Panel() output)
- Documentation requirements (all features must be in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
